# Battery Informer (Without React)
 A plain application that informs you of your device battery reaching higher than 90%. User is able to set the custom battery option from the settings, however, that feature is currently underway. Until then, why not enjoy getting a notification when device battery reaches higher than 90%.
 
 Do note that the application will run in the background instead of foreground so if you don't see anything, look at your tray of taskbar having a Batetery Notifier symbol.
